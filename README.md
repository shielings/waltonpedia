# Waltonpedia

## A wiki for doctors working at The Walton Centre

### Why?
The information needed to work at this hospital was previously fragmeneted between the intranet, emails, induction paperwork, posters and word-of mouth. This project aims to bridge these means to provide a rapid, accurate source of information.

### What makes this better than the intranet, emails etc...?
- Rapid access - a memorable URL and public access for non-sensitive data
- Enjoyable to use - a sparkle of our personalities can shine through
- Editable by those willing to make improvements
- Pervasive and consistent - no "this is an old PDF" found in an email
- Highly auditable - every update to every page is kept, together wity
